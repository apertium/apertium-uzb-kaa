PROBLEM STATEMENT
=================

A problem with testvoc is that it takes long time to run.

We can come up with a simpler and faster testvoc which is a close approximation
of the full testvoc if we make following simplifying assumptions:
   * monodixes are trimmed;
   * there aren't any transfer rules which work selectively on lemmas;
   * SL words of particular POS correspond to words of one particular POS in TL.

The first assumption holds true, the second and the third are not always the
case, and we will make corresponding tweaks to our 'simple testvoc' process
later.

If we assume three things above, then testvocing one word per each paradigm
definition becomes a reasonable substition for the full testvoc.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS
==========================

Note that in context of a lexc file, paradigm definition is a lexicon which is
a direct continuation of stems. For each such lexicon, there is compressed text file
in apertium-uzb/tests/morphotactics, which contains the full paradigm of a word
linked to that lexicon. The name of a file indicates which lexicon it represents,
e.g. A1.txt.gz.

The job of the testvoc.sh script in this directory is to extract lexical forms
from that text files, and run them through the translator pipeline, as the usual
testvoc script would.
